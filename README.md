## Scrapy Projects

The project contains 3 example scrapy projects written in Python that demonstrate 3 concepts.  

1. **Handling single request & response** by extracting a city's weather from a weather site - [weather.com](https://github.com/karthikn2789/Scrapy-Projects/tree/master/weather)
2. **Handling multiple request & response** by extracting book details from a dummy online book store - [bookstoscrape](https://github.com/karthikn2789/Scrapy-Projects/tree/master/bookstoscrape)
3. **Image scraping** - [imagescraper](https://github.com/karthikn2789/Scrapy-Projects/tree/master/imagescraper)
   
To run these examples, [Scrapy](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/) needs to be installed. Scrapy can be installed either through anaconda or pip.

`conda install -c conda-forge scrapy`

or

`pip install Scrapy`
